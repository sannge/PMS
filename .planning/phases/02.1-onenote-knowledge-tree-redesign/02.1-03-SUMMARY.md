# Phase 02.1 Plan 03: Remove Scope Filter and Scope Picker Dialog Summary

**Deleted scope-filter.tsx and scope-picker-dialog.tsx; cleaned FolderTree of all ScopePickerDialog and 'all' scope remnants**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T05:52:30Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T05:54:46Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1 modified, 2 deleted

## Accomplishments
- Removed stale ScopePickerDialog comments and empty handler sections from FolderTree
- Deleted scope-filter.tsx (244 lines) and scope-picker-dialog.tsx (178 lines)
- Verified zero dangling imports across entire renderer directory

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update FolderTree to remove 'all' scope and ScopePickerDialog** - `c1d3fa4` (refactor)
2. **Task 2: Delete scope-filter.tsx and scope-picker-dialog.tsx** - `ef980c5` (refactor)

## Files Created/Modified
- `electron-app/src/renderer/components/knowledge/folder-tree.tsx` - Removed stale ScopePickerDialog comment, empty state section, empty handler section
- `electron-app/src/renderer/components/knowledge/scope-filter.tsx` - Deleted
- `electron-app/src/renderer/components/knowledge/scope-picker-dialog.tsx` - Deleted

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None. The knowledge-sidebar.tsx file had already been updated by 02.1-01 to remove ScopeFilter references, so no additional cleanup was needed there.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Scope filter components fully removed; tree relies on tab-based scope from context
- Ready for Plan 04 (remaining tree UI refinements)
